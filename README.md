# Vehicle Maintenance Service Java Application

This is a desktop application developed using JavaFX, Hibernate, and Oracle Database to manage the operations of a vehicle maintenance service center.

## Project Description

This application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) allowing users to manage appointments, customers, vehicles, mechanics, inventory, service items, and generate reports. It also includes a role-based access control system.

## Key Features

*   **Appointment Management:**
    *   Add, edit, delete appointments
    *   Table view and calendar view for displaying appointments
    *   Search appointments by customer, date, or status
    *   Handle appointment statuses (Scheduled, In Progress, Completed, Paid, Cancelled)
*   **Customer Management:** Add, edit, search customer data
*   **Vehicle Management:** Add, edit, search vehicle data associated with customers
*   **Mechanic Management:** Add, edit, search mechanic data, including specializations
*   **Inventory Management:** Manage stock levels and prices of repair parts
*   **Service Item Management:** Define repair service items and their prices
*   **Service-Inventory Linking:** Link service items to required inventory parts
*   **User & Permission Management:**
    *   Manage user accounts
    *   Define roles (e.g., Admin, Receptionist, Mechanic)
    *   Assign specific table read/write permissions to each role
*   **Reporting System:**
    *   Generate revenue reports (by year, month, service type)
    *   Generate invoice reports (by invoice ID, customer, date range, status)
    *   Export reports to PDF files
*   **Login & Authentication:** Username and password authentication, role-based feature access

## Technologies Used

*   **Programming Language:** Java 17+
*   **User Interface:** JavaFX
*   **Database:** Oracle Database
*   **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):** Hibernate
*   **Build Tool:** Apache Maven
*   **Database Scripts:** SQL (PL/SQL for packages)

## Environment Setup & Installation

1.  **Get the Code:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd vehicle-maintenance-service-java
    ```
2.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Ensure you have Oracle Database installed and running.
    *   Connect to your database using an SQL client (like SQL*Plus or SQL Developer).
    *   Execute the SQL scripts located in the `db changes` directory to create the necessary database structures and packages:
        *   Run `CREATE_SCHEMA_*.sql` to create the user/schema (if needed).
        *   Run `context.sql` to create the application context.
        *   Execute the other `*_pkg_*.sql` files sequentially to create the database packages.
3.  **Configure Hibernate:**
    *   Edit the `src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml` file.
    *   Update the database connection properties (URL, username, password) to match your Oracle database setup.
4.  **Build the Project:**
    *   Build the project using Maven. Open a terminal and run:
        ```bash
        mvn clean install
        ```
    *   This will download dependencies and compile the code, producing an executable JAR file (usually in the `target` directory).
5.  **Run the Application:**
    *   You can run the `ca.humber.App` main class from your IDE.
    *   Alternatively, execute the JAR file generated by the Maven build (you might need to include the JavaFX module path depending on your setup).

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Login:** Log in to the application using a valid username and password. Default users and permissions might be set up in the database scripts.
2.  **Navigation:** Use the top tabs to switch between different management modules (e.g., Appointments, Customers, Inventory).
3.  **Operations:**
    *   Use the buttons above the tables (Add, Edit, Delete, Refresh) to manage data.
    *   Fill in or modify information in the forms and click "Save" or "Update".
    *   Use the search fields to filter data within the tables.
4.  **Calendar View (Appointments):**
    *   In the "Appointments" tab, switch to the "Calendar View".
    *   Use the month navigation buttons to view appointments for different months.
    *   Click on a date cell to view appointments for that day or to add a new appointment.
    *   Click on an appointment card to view its details in the table view.
5.  **Generate Reports:**
    *   Go to the "Reports" tab.
    *   Select the report type (Revenue or Invoice).
    *   Set the filter criteria (date, customer, status, etc.).
    *   Click "Generate Report".
    *   Click "Save Report" to export the report as a PDF.

## Database Setup Details

*   The `db changes` directory contains all necessary SQL scripts.
*   `CREATE_SCHEMA_*.sql`: Used to create the database user and grant basic privileges .
*   `context.sql`: Creates an application context used to store the currently logged-in user ID.
*   `*_pkg_*.sql`: These files contain PL/SQL packages that encapsulate most of the database logic (querying, inserting, updating, deleting operations). Ensure they are executed in a logical order based on dependencies (e.g., packages for base tables first).
